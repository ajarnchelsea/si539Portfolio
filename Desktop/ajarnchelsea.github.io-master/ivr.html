					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The <b>Maestro System</b> 				
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>It was the perfect problem for me to investigate as part of my individual project for my Introduction to Interaction Design class.</b>
					</p>
					</div>

					<div id="opportunity">
					<h2>Problem Scope</h2>
						<p>In casual conversation with staff and residents, I discovered that several types of questions about events and programming at Munger often tended to rise to the surface. I found that these themes were consistent with recurring types of questions posted on the Munger Facebook group:</p>
					<h3>Question Type 1: "What’s going on tonight?"</h3>
					<img src="images/fbfb1.png" alt="" class="portphotos" id="fbimg"/>
						<p>Because there is no central resource for residents to view or learn more about events going on in the building at any given time, they are often unsure whether certain events are closed/private functions, or whether they are open to all residents.<br></p>
					<h3>Question Type 2: "How can I share my event with the community?"</h3>
					<img src="images/fbfb2.png" alt="" class="portphotos" id="fbimg"/>
						<p>The Munger Facebook group is currently the widest platform residents can use to promote their programs. However, not every resident is a member of the group, and users have experienced difficulties utilizing Facebook events as a central resource for community event sharing.<br></p>
					<h3>Question Type 3: "Will anyone attend my event?"</h3>
					<img src="images/fbfb3.png" alt="" class="portphotos" id="fbimg"/>
						<p>As a new community, Munger collectively has a limited amount of data and experience to consult when considering whether there is enough resident interest in a program idea, or which dates and times would best meet the needs of a diverse group of students with busy schedules.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="requirements">
					<h2>Requirements</h2>
					<p>I set the following goals to guide my design process:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Demystify the program and event creation process</li>
							<li>Build community by enabling members to quickly and easily promote programs</li>
							<li>Empower community members to pursue ideas collaboratively</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					
					<div id="methods">
					<h2>Process</h2>
						<h3>Personas</h3>
						<p>After conducting preliminary research, I first created personas of target users. I found that the two largest user groups would consist of community staff members and community residents.</p>

						<img src="images/persona1.png" alt=""/>
						<img src="images/persona2.png" alt=""/>
						</div>
	

						<h3>Storyboarding</h3>
						<p>I then sketched out 8 concepts, with storyboards illustrating the scenarios in which these solutions might be used. </p>

						<img src="images/scen2.png" alt="" id="portphotos"/>
						</div>
						
						<h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
						<p>After interviewing 4 additional residents, I decided to focus my design on a mobile application centered around an event calendar. I created a paper prototype, and tested it with 3 classmates and 3 residents. By testing the paper prototypes with target users, I was able to better identify the priorities of residents and iteratively improve on the design.</p>

					<h3>Digital Prototype</h3>
					<p>Finally, I developed a digital, interactive version of my prototype using Sketch and InVision.<br/>
					With my digital prototype, I was able to test out several key features of the platform. Users can:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>create, promote, and manage the logistical details of their events</li>
							<li>send out updates about last-minute changes to events (room, date, time, etc)</li>
							<li>view the list of registered guests</li>
							<li>register for other users' events</li>
							<li>provide feedback on events they’ve hosted or attended</li>
							<li>share events they are interested in attending with their friends</li>
						</ul></p>

					<h2>Takeaways</h2>
						<p>I worked on Munger Events during my first semester of graduate school. As I embarked on my first interaction design project, I ran into many roadblocks familiar to the novice designer: getting attached to particular concepts for my final design even while conducting preliminary research; designing microinteractions first, instead of first outlining the system at a high level; and accidentally getting carried away with my color palette, eventually leading to an overwhelming, maximalist visual aesthetic.<br><br>
						I learned a lot from this project. I now take care to pare down the information presented on each screen I design to prevent overloading the user. I've internalized gestalt principles of similarity and proximity, and employ them to ensure users can easily navigate through my visual designs. I've also learned to take it easy with the color palette, and to employ only as much color as necessary.<br><br>
						Most importantly, however, I learned how to structure my research process so that I focus on addressing user needs, not just my own. When I showed residents my prototype, some were interested but ultimately expressed that they already had too many calendars to keep track of in their lives. Another calendar platform would just lead to more confusion. Now, Munger sends out a weekly newsletter with community events, and the staff have adopted a university-wide events registration platform. Now, I try to be more open to less conventional solutions; those can lead to some of the most interesting innovations.
